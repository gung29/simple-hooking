# Function Hooking in Ninja Kaizen Game

## About

The `simple-hooking` project aims to provide a clear and concise example of how to implement hooks in the Ninja Kaizen game. It utilizes Minhook, a minimalistic x86/x64 API hooking library for Windows, to intercept and modify game functions dynamically.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gung29/simple-hooking.git

2. **Explore the Code**
Dive into the code to understand the hooking mechanisms implemented for Ninja Kaizen.

3. **Build the Project**
Compile the project to generate the DLL using Visual Studio 2022.

4. **Injecting the DLL**
Once the DLL is built, use a DLL injector of your choice to inject it into Ninja Kaizen. If you're new to DLL injection, you might find tools like [Extreme Injector](https://github.com/master131/ExtremeInjector) helpful.
