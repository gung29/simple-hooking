# Function Hooking in Ninja Kaizen, previously called Ninja Storm

Welcome to `simple-hooking`, a tool designed to showcase easy-to-follow yet impactful methods of function hooking in the game Ninja Kaizen, utilizing the power of the Minhook library. This repository is the perfect starting point for enthusiasts and developers keen on delving into the world of game modification and dynamic function hooking on the Windows platform.

## About

The `simple-hooking` project aims to provide a clear and concise example of how to implement hooks in the Ninja Kaizen game. It utilizes Minhook, a minimalistic x86/x64 API hooking library for Windows, to intercept and modify game functions dynamically.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agungsadu/simple-hooking.git

2. **Explore the Code**
Dive into the code to understand the hooking mechanisms implemented for Ninja Kaizen.

3. **Build the Project**
Compile the project to generate the DLL using Visual Studio 2022.

4. **Injecting the DLL**
Once the DLL is built, use a DLL injector of your choice to inject it into Ninja Kaizen. If you're new to DLL injection, you might find tools like [Extreme Injector](https://github.com/master131/ExtremeInjector) helpful.
